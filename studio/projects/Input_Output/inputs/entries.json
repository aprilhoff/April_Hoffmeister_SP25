    "card_1_paragraph": "This card symbolizes a moment of intense struggle, where despite your best efforts, the forces of fate seem unstoppable. You may be facing a challenge that feels insurmountable, and even though you're pushing forward with all your strength, there is a sense that things are not in your control. The Knight's desperate defense reflects a situation where you’re trying to hold on or fight against a change you can’t avoid. You may feel wounded, either emotionally or physically, but you're still resisting, still fighting until the very end.",
    "card_2_paragraph": "This card speaks to the inevitability of change, the unavoidable nature of loss, and the reality that some things, no matter how hard we try, cannot be saved. It’s a reminder to confront what you’ve been avoiding. There may be something in your life that has been gradually sinking, and the moment has come to acknowledge it fully. Whether it’s a relationship, job, or belief, the Shipman calls you to let go of what’s no longer serving you.",
    "card_3_paragraph": "This card may suggest that you are focusing too much on what could happen in the future, and it’s time to bring your attention back to the present moment. It can indicate that while planning and foresight are valuable, you should not become so consumed with predictions that you forget to live in the here and now. It can also represent an over-reliance on others’ advice or predictions, warning that no one, not even an astrologer, can truly predict or control your fate. It’s a sign that it’s time to trust your own judgment, rather than relying on external sources to shape your decisions."

    "card_3_paragraph": "The Count signifies wealth, power, and status.

The Bishop advises you to reassess your spiritual path and consider whether your practices are driven by genuine desire for enlightenment or by ego.

In the context of greed, this card urges you to reflect on your own motivations in healing or helping others. Are you truly acting in the best interests of those you serve, or is there a subconscious desire to benefit from the power or influence you hold over others? The Physician card in this light may also suggest that you should be cautious of individuals in your life who may be using their position of care or authority for self-serving purposes, whether that means taking advantage of others or seeking to profit off their misfortune."
