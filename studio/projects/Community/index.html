        <p>Prototyped is an ongoing online anthology of design works shared and collected amongst its community. Created and designed by April Hoffmeister, the archive aims to allow designers to get access and inspiration from unusual and secluded works. Typeset in Artigo.

        <span>why?</span> Whilst the normally used design inspiration spaces like Pinterest and Instagram can be helpful, they can be disappointing due to the uniformity of the design shared there. It feels that important physical works that have not yet been digitised or are not spotlighted in the feed are forgotten. Prototyped brings those works to the spotlight, highlighting work submitted by individuals like you! 
        <br>
        <br>
        <span>upload.</span> From the navigator bar, anyone has the option to upload scanned work through an email submission. Any kind of physical work will be considered; posters, books, postcards, etc.
